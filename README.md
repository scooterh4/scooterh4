<h1>Hello 👋</h1>

My name is Scott and I'm a Full Stack Software Developer between Calgary, AB and Squamish, BC. Outside of programming, I love rock climbing 🧗‍♂️, sking ⛷️, the Calgary Flames 🔥, and science fiction 📖.

🔨 Currently I'm working on a sudoku web app made with React called [webdoku.](https://github.com/scooterh4/webdoku)

✔️ I've created a React web app that allows users to log their indoor rock climbs. This was my first time using React, and I learned a lot in the process. You can checkout the [repo](https://github.com/scooterh4/crimpdaddy) or the [latest deployment.](https://crimpdaddy-db2af.web.app/)

💻 When I'm not contributing to a project, I'm usually doing Leetcode problems. Checkout my [Leetcode profile.](https://leetcode.com/scooterh/)

🏫 Two years ago, I took an Object-Oriented Software Development program in Calgary, AB. I contributed to several group projects during this time. They can be seen either [here](https://github.com/JackyLuong/Travel-Experts-Workshop-5) or [here.](https://github.com/MaratNikitin/CSharpDesktopWorkshop4). 

🔰 One of the first projects I did was for a Udacity Nanodegree. I created an interactive command line application in Python. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/scooterh4/pdsnd_github)
